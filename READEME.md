# Dev Notes

Hello Ryan here! This section of the repo is made just to log the entire development journey from all the milestones and setbacks I encounter. I'll try to be as open/transparent and frequent with these updates as the project progresses.

## Dev Log - 02/13/2024

I couldn't get any of my group members code to run on my local machine so I remade it all from scratch and salvaged what I deemed usable (model folder for all the schemas, and the dockerfile). I'll be setting up a simple front-end registration, login and sign up page, API calls, and Routes myself

I finished the basic routing for 3 pages as of today register, login, and homepage for students and was able to have front end post all the data into my mongodb database via tables and schema

Here is my registration page with a successful post request
